# NLP---Sentence-Similarity-and-Triple-Extraction
Part 1: Sentence Similarity
This part of the repository focuses on exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) functionalities such as tokenization, stemming, and word embeddings to determine the similarity between two sentences or paragraphs. Two approaches, bag-of-words and word embeddings, are implemented and compared for their effectiveness in capturing semantic similarity.

Features:
Tokenization: Utilizes tokenization techniques to break down sentences into meaningful units.
Stemming: Applies stemming to reduce words to their base or root form.
Bag-of-Words: Implements the bag-of-words model to represent textual data as a vector of word frequencies.
Word Embeddings: Utilizes pre-trained word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words.


Part 2: Triple Extraction
This part focuses on the extraction of triples (subject, verb, object) from a given sentence. The approach involves using a dependency-based parser to extract dependency relations, followed by reasoning to form triples based on these relations.

Features:
Dependency Parsing: Implements a dependency-based parser to identify grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
Triple Extraction: Utilizes dependency relations to extract triples (subject, verb, object) from sentences.
Reasoning: Incorporates reasoning mechanisms to enhance the accuracy of triple extraction.
